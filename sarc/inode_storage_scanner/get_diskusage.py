"""
This is not a complete implementation.
It is just a stub, notes for what needs to be done.

Some of the configuration was added to the `sarc-dev.json` file
so as to have information about the commands specific to our clusters.

Because this project is currently under reorganization,
it is not clear how the configuration will be loaded,
how to run commands through ssh or where this script
will run.


Basically, this script will go through all the clusters
found in the config file and it will look for those that
have the keys "duc_inodes_command", "duc_storage_command", "diskusage_report_command".
If the "cluster_name" argument is specific at command-line,
it will only process that one.

The commands found will be run on the cluster and the output
will be parsed and stored in the database.
As of now, we think that "diskusage_report_command" contains
all the information and we don't need to run the other two commands.
Nevertheless, some sanity check is in order.

It is also recommended to add an option to simply dump
the contents of the files on the disk instead of committing
to the database. This will allow us to check the output for
debugging, and also to generate properly anonymized equivalents
meant for testing.
