"""
This script will ingest three different sources of data and will produce
a JSON file called "matches_done.json" that will contain a list of
all the possible matches between Mila users and CC/DRAC accounts.

There are a lot of irregularities in the worlds of accounts coming from Mila
and from DRAC, so this script needs to have many exceptions written somewhere.
Because those exceptions involve names of Mila members and their email addresses,
we have to keep this private, despite how convenient it would be at times to
have some statements like `if name == "johnappleseed@mila.quebec"`.

These all need to come from a specific configuration file, and that file is include
with the other secrets in the "secrets/account_matching" directory.
