Please edit the included YAML configuration to implement whatever instructions
are included in ## comments, which you should edit out. Only return the modified
configuration, without any ``` delimiters.

The configuration matches to the following dataclasses:

@dataclass
class Query:
    cluster: str | None = None
    start: datetime | None = None
    end: datetime | None = None

@dataclass
class Table:
    # The strings are eval() expressions that have access to jobs (a DataFrame)
    # and pandas via the variable pd
    filters: list[str] = field(default_factory=list)
    highlight: dict[str, str] = field(default_factory=dict)
    columns: list[str] = field(default_factory=list)
    new_columns: dict[str, str] = field(default_factory=dict)
    sort: str | None = None
    limit: int = 100

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class Layout:
    editor: str | bool = True
    table: str | bool = False
    plot: str | bool = True

@dataclass
class PlottingConfig:
    query: Query
    layout: Layout = Layout()
    plot: Plot | None = None
    table: Table | None = None

Plot is formatted specially:

* It builds a plotnine ggplot
* Any keys starting with a tilde such as ~x are arguments to aes(...)
* Top-level keys should match a function in plotnine
* Arguments to top-level keys are given to these functions
* All the top-level keys are added together to the resulting plot

Columns in the jobs dataframe:
* cluster_name: str
* user: str
* gpu_utilization: float  # between 0 and 1
* start_time: datetime
* end_time: datetime
